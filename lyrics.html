            Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad
            Time really moves fast, fast, fast, fast
            Better hurry up and get in your bag, bag, bag, bag
            I wear Dior, not a fad, 'ad, 'ad, 'ad
            I know all these niggas gettin' mad, mad, mad, mad
            My hand on my trigger, I'ma die with respect, yeah
            Fucking with my money, you'll get dealt like that, yeah
            I took too many pills, count up the bills, uh
            Molly in my cup, I can't tell you how I feel, uh
            Oh, last call
            Oh-oh, that's gnarly
            Every day I be counting up, counting up the blues
            Count away, sometimes we always lose
            I get high as a bitch, still the same dude
            I was back then, and now I'm lost and confused
            I ain't see it coming
            I ain't see it coming
            But it still came
            I'm talkin' 'bout life, ayy (Talkin' 'bout life)
            I been living fast, fast, fast, fast
            Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad
            Time really moves fast, fast, fast, fast

            Fucking with my money, you'll get dealt like that, yeah
            I go through so much, I'm 19 years old
            It's been months since I felt at home
            But it's okay 'cause I'm rich
            Psych, I'm still sad as a bitch, right
            I don't want nobody to think that I'm an asshole
            I don't try to be mean on purpose, I promise
            My mama taught me better than that, I'll be honest
            I blame it on the drugs and this life I'm involved in
            I ain't see it coming (I ain't see it)
            I ain't see it coming (I ain't see it)
            But it still came (Yeah, yeah, it still came)
            I'm talkin' 'bout life, ayy (Talkin' 'bout life)
            I been living fast, fast, fast, fast
            Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad
            Time really moves fast, fast, fast, fast

            I wear Dior, not a fad, 'ad, 'ad, 'ad
            I know all these niggas gettin' mad, mad, mad, mad
            My hand on my trigger, I'ma die with respect, yeah
            Fucking with my money, you'll get dealt like that, yeah
            Elevate, elevate, elevate myself
            Now I'm on the ground
            On the ground haven't been myself
            But it's okay, it's cool, won't push the issue
            What happens next? Story to be continued, yeah
            I been living fast, fast, fast, fast
            Feeling really bad, bad, bad, bad
            Time really moves fast, fast, fast, fast
